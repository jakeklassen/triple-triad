# Backend Supabase

## Commands

`npx supabase start`

## Status

This is currently on hold because supabase edge functions run in deno and we can't figure out how to import `@tripletriad/game` from the monorepo to run on deno deploy.

Supabase edge functions seems to be backed by deno deploy so this adds up.
